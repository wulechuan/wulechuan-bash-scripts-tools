# This file will be available for *ALL* senarios anyway,
# despite it being named "my-company".
#
# In fact, all files under the folder "_common-configurations"
# are available for ALL senarios.
#
# Allowing to create multiple files is simply for
# better organziations of all kinds of configurations.
#
# Also note that only '*.sh' will be `source`d.
# So whenever you'd like to disable a configuration set,
# simple change the file extension to something other than '.sh'.
